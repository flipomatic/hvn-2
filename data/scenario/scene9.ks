Predictably, the mailbox is empty. [p]
You have already been scooped by your father. [p]

The streets are empty. [p]
Wind skims the voids keeping neighbors apart, as if grazing the hollow of a cut reed, or say, a plundered mailbox. [p]
A familiar note is produced. [p]
It's the one Desolation plays to keep its instrument in tune.[p]
It is your thirteenth birthday, and as with all twelve preceding it, something feels missing from your life. [p]
The game presently eluding you is only the latest sleight of hand in the repertoire of an unseen riddler, one to engender a sense not of mirth, but of lack. [p]
His coarse schemes are those less of a prankster than a common pickpocket. [p]
His riddle is Absence itself. [p]
It is a mystery dispersing altogether, like the moon's faint reflection, with even one pebble of inquiry dropped in its black well. It is the most diabolical riddle of all.[p]
"Absence diminishes little passions and increases great ones, as wind extinguishes candles and fans a fire." -Walt Whitman[p]
Yes, you are certain Walt Whitman said that. [p]
One hundred percent positive.[p]
You have a feeling it's going to be a long day. [p]

The door is locked and your DAD has the CAR KEYS. [p]
You peer in through the driver's side window. [p]

You don't see any mail, but you do see a GREEN PACKAGE. [p]
There is also something underneath it that looks like a slip of paper.[p]
Could these items have come in the mail? [p]
You don't see anything else that's usually in the mail, like bills and coupons. [p]
Maybe your DAD forgot to take this stuff inside. [p]

You try to get a gander through the KITCHEN WINDOW, but you can't see a whole lot! [p]
It seems your DAD has been doing so much baking, the glass has steamed up.[p]
God he is so weird.[p]
But you can see what's on the table just beside the window. [p]
It looks like the mail is there! Included among it is a RED PACKAGE, some BILLS, your DAD'S PDA, and an envelope that appears to be suspiciously labeled with the SBURB LOGO. [p]
Could it be???[p]
Unfortunately, the window is locked. [p]
